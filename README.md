# seam-carving
Seam carving changes the size of an image by removing the least visible pixels in the image. The visibility of a pixel can be defined using an energy function. Seam carving can be done by finding an one-pixel wide path of lowest energy crossing the image from top to bottom (vertical path) or from left to right (horizontal path) and removing the path (seam).
